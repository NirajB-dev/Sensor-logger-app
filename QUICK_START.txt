SENSOR DATA LOGGING APP - QUICK START GUIDE
=============================================

WHAT THIS APP DOES:
-------------------
- Records GPS location data (latitude, longitude, altitude, speed, direction)
- Records magnetometer data (EMF readings from phone's magnetic sensor)
- Shows live data on screen with charts
- Saves data to Firebase cloud database
- Exports data as CSV file
- Perfect for mapping EMF hotspots and analyzing electromagnetic fields

HOW TO RUN:
-----------

OPTION 1 - INSTALL APK (EASIEST):
1. Copy "sensor_data_logging_app.apk" to your Android phone
2. Enable "Install from Unknown Sources" in phone settings
3. Tap the APK file to install
4. Open the app and grant location permissions
5. Tap "Start Recording" to begin data collection

OPTION 2 - RUN FROM SOURCE CODE:
1. Install Flutter SDK:
   - Download from https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
   - Add Flutter to your PATH
   - Run: flutter doctor (to check setup)

2. Setup Android Development:
   - Install Android Studio
   - Enable USB debugging on your Android phone
   - Connect phone via USB cable
   - Run: flutter devices (to see connected devices)

3. Run the App:
   - Open terminal/command prompt
   - Navigate to project folder
   - Run: cd flutter_app
   - Run: flutter pub get (install dependencies)
   - Run: flutter run (builds and installs app on phone)

4. Alternative Commands:
   - flutter run -d [device_id] (run on specific device)
   - flutter build apk (create APK file)
   - flutter clean (clean build cache)

HOW TO USE:
-----------
1. Open the app
2. Grant location permissions when prompted
3. Tap "Start Recording" - app will collect GPS and magnetometer data
4. Walk around to collect data points
5. Tap "Stop Recording" when done
6. Tap "View Charts" to see data visualizations
7. Tap "Export CSV" to save data to phone
8. Data is automatically saved to Firebase cloud

WHAT YOU GET:
-------------
- Live GPS coordinates on screen
- Live magnetometer readings (EMF data)
- Interactive charts showing data over time
- CSV file with all collected data
- Cloud storage in Firebase for analysis

TECHNICAL STUFF:
----------------
- Built with Flutter (Dart)
- Uses phone's GPS and magnetometer sensors
- Charts made with Syncfusion
- Cloud storage with Firebase
- Exports data as CSV files

PERFECT FOR:
------------
- Mapping electromagnetic field hotspots
- Analyzing EMF exposure patterns
- Research on electromagnetic radiation
- Urban computing assignments
- Environmental monitoring

TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
- Make sure location permissions are granted
- Ensure phone has GPS enabled
- Check internet connection for Firebase
- Restart app if sensors don't work

RUNNING COMMANDS REFERENCE:
---------------------------
# Check Flutter setup
flutter doctor

# See connected devices
flutter devices

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run app on connected device
flutter run

# Run on specific device
flutter run -d [device_id]

# Build release APK
flutter build apk --release

# Clean build cache
flutter clean

# Check for updates
flutter upgrade

That's it! Simple sensor data collection app for EMF research.
